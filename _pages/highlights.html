            <h2>Simulating quantum magnetism with atomically precise spin arrays</h2>
            <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21274-5", target="_blank"><em>Nature Communications 12, 993 (2021)</em></a>
            <p>Designing and characterizing the many-body behaviors of quantum materials represents a prominent challenge for understanding strongly correlated physics and quantum information processing. We constructed artificial quantum magnets on a surface by using spin-1/2 atoms in a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). These coupled spins feature strong quantum fluctuations due to antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between neighboring atoms. To characterize the resulting collective magnetic states and their energy levels, we performed electron spin resonance on individual atoms within each quantum magnet. This gives atomic-scale access to properties of the exotic quantum many-body states, such as a finite-size realization of a resonating valence bond state. The tunable atomic-scale magnetic field from the STM tip allows us to further characterize and engineer the quantum states. These results open a new avenue to designing and exploring quantum magnets at the atomic scale for applications in spintronics and quantum simulations.</p>

            <h2>Coherent surface spin manipulation</h2>
            <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aay6779", target="_blank"><em>Science 366, 509 (2019)</em></a>
            <p>Spin-based quantum information processing requires coherent spin manipulation. We demonstrate coherent control of surface titanium and iron atom spins on a magnesium oxide surface with a magnetic scanning tunneling microscope tip. Arbitrary sequences of fast electrical pulses delivered to the top induced large electric fields. These fields drove metal-atom movement, which then modulated the tip-atom exchange interaction to create an oscillating effective magnetic field. Advanced spin-control protocols such as Ramsey fringes and Hahn spin echoes revealed quantum dynamics, such as coherent oscillations in a titanium atom dimer assembled on the surface with the tip.</p>
